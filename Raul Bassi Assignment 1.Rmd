# Assignment 1

I am supposed to write some paragraphs to see how this would look as a PDF document.

The hardest part of this homework was downloading LaTex, because there is no button that lead to a download in their web page.

I hope this works.

I suppose I have added enough paragraphs for today.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
a <- seq(1:10)
b <- a*a
plot(a, b)
```
